# OM4-figures

This repo is for collecting the scripts used to make figures for the OM4 documentation paper.

Guidelines:
1. Use a directory if using more than one script.
1. Generated figures should have a discriptive name that will match the figure label in the document. This will help us associate figures and scripts.
  -  e.g. atlantic-meridional-overturning.png, \ref{fig:atlantic-meridional-overturning}
1. Use only one image per figure (reading multple images per figure really slows down compilation)
1. Generated figures need not be more thatn 0.5Mb to get print quality. Excessively large figures slow down compilation and do not improve print quality.
1. Help Aparna by referencing all paths to data at the top of your scripts.
